# Credit-Suisse-Coding-Challenge-2021
It is the year 2038 and robots have the right to get paid for the work they do. As an employer of robots, you need to calculate how much a robot gets paid for cleaning your apartment.     How much a robot gets paid depends on when you ask the robot to work. After all, during the day the robot can be a little louder and work a bit faster whilst everyone is out of the house, but at night, you will need to turn on the super quiet mode, which takes more effort! Robots also cost a bit more over weekends, due to higher demand.     Your robot rates calculator needs to consider the following:  ·         A standard minutely rate for weekdays, and an ‘extra’ rate for weekends.  ·         When rates switches between day and night rates, for a total of four different rates (weekday/weekend + day/night).  ·         For every eight hours, the robot needs to take an hour of unpaid break (or part thereof) for planned system maintenance.
